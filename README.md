Exploring Wikipedia Clickstream Data Analysis
Description
Wikipedia regularly releases clickstream statistics, which monitor the combined user paths between its pages. Traditional statistical approaches can yield interesting insights from the links between articles, but they often miss important details when working with such large datasets.

To glean insights from these linkages, we in this study employ network analysis. By creating a graph model of the clickstream data, we may study the network's structure, pinpoint the most significant nodes, find themes or subjects in the data using community identification, and investigate patterns of unusual Wikipedia browsing behavior using shell decomposition.

Results
The initial findings will be shared by next milestones along with the visualizations and model implementation.
